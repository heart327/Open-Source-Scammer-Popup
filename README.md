# Open Source Scammer Popup (OSSP)

A [tech support scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0346-tech-support-scams "tech support scam") popup that's open source, created so [scambaiters](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/ "scambaiters") can create silly popups whenever scammers ask *"Can I see the popup on your screen?"*
